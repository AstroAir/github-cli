# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical usability issues in the GitHub CLI's authentication system, specifically focusing on improving the login pop-up window's adaptability to different terminal sizes and enhancing the user experience when authentication attempts fail. The current implementation has limitations in responsive design and lacks comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms for failed login attempts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the GitHub CLI on various terminal sizes, I want the login pop-up window to automatically adapt to my terminal dimensions, so that I can always see all authentication information clearly regardless of my screen size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the login screen is displayed THEN the system SHALL automatically detect the current terminal dimensions
2. WHEN the terminal width is less than 80 characters THEN the system SHALL use a compact vertical layout for the authentication screen
3. WHEN the terminal width is 80 characters or more THEN the system SHALL use the standard horizontal layout
4. WHEN the terminal height is less than 20 lines THEN the system SHALL hide non-essential UI elements and show only critical authentication information
5. WHEN the user resizes the terminal during authentication THEN the system SHALL dynamically adjust the layout without interrupting the authentication flow
6. WHEN displaying the device code and verification URL THEN the system SHALL ensure both are fully visible within the current terminal bounds

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer experiencing authentication failures, I want clear feedback and recovery options, so that I can understand what went wrong and easily retry the authentication process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authentication attempt fails due to network issues THEN the system SHALL display a specific error message indicating network connectivity problems
2. WHEN an authentication attempt fails due to expired device code THEN the system SHALL automatically offer to restart the authentication flow
3. WHEN an authentication attempt fails due to user denial THEN the system SHALL display a clear message and provide options to retry or cancel
4. WHEN multiple authentication failures occur THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff with clear countdown timers
5. WHEN the system encounters rate limiting THEN the system SHALL display the wait time and automatically retry after the specified interval
6. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information while showing user-friendly messages in the UI

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer using the GitHub CLI, I want improved visual feedback during the authentication process, so that I understand the current status and what actions I need to take.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the authentication flow starts THEN the system SHALL display a progress indicator showing the current step
2. WHEN waiting for user authorization THEN the system SHALL show an animated indicator with elapsed time
3. WHEN the device code is generated THEN the system SHALL highlight the code with clear visual emphasis
4. WHEN the browser fails to open automatically THEN the system SHALL provide alternative methods to access the verification URL
5. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL display a clear success message with user information
6. WHEN the authentication screen is active THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for canceling the process

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working in different environments, I want the authentication system to handle various edge cases gracefully, so that I can authenticate successfully regardless of my setup constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in a headless environment THEN the system SHALL detect the absence of a display and provide text-only instructions
2. WHEN clipboard access is available THEN the system SHALL automatically copy the verification URL to the clipboard
3. WHEN the system cannot open a browser THEN the system SHALL provide manual instructions and QR code alternatives where possible
4. WHEN running in a restricted network environment THEN the system SHALL provide detailed troubleshooting information
5. WHEN authentication tokens expire during use THEN the system SHALL automatically prompt for re-authentication with context about the expiration
6. WHEN multiple GitHub accounts are configured THEN the system SHALL allow users to select which account to authenticate with

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer who frequently switches between different terminal environments, I want the authentication interface to remember my preferences and adapt accordingly, so that I have a consistent and efficient authentication experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has previously used compact mode THEN the system SHALL remember this preference for future authentication attempts
2. WHEN the system detects a known terminal environment THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate layout optimizations
3. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL store successful authentication patterns for future optimization
4. WHEN the user cancels authentication multiple times THEN the system SHALL offer to save authentication preferences to avoid repeated prompts
5. WHEN the system detects accessibility needs THEN the system SHALL automatically enable high-contrast mode and screen reader compatibility
6. WHEN running in different terminal emulators THEN the system SHALL adapt to terminal-specific capabilities and limitations
